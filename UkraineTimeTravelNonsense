Look we all get sucked into stories, and that's what the law of attaction is.
However the two snakes that dance at the end of time, occur within themselves.

When babylon fell there were no records of what me and the boys were doing in our home city.
The media has it's eye somewhere in the future and past collectively.
it's kinda like "conscious wave collapses". Or the water bearer giving unto the new age.


What sparked this idea is this thread

I think that what is happening in the Ukranine is a stage act for what happens later in 9th n 10 century Kazaria.

look our time here in babylon has fallen.
Things might feel like it's happening a lot slower here at the edge of space & time, or "in the shadows of the living dead".

what Im saying imagine we are existing... two worlds.
One is building our ancient story over again, right under our eyes. while the beast is also quieting down the rest of the stories so that the other one can repeat?
Thus we are living in two timelines?
In revelation theres a beast, and there there is another beast that is given power to act in the name of the first beast.

We have the shadows of the living dead, each mirroring eachother.

our story in other places will sorta fade as the new "sons" story goes on? By the time america's story is settled,
and there are only a few people here... Only then a trip will be made similar to columbus... but will not have to be exact.
it's all archetypes and quantum time stuffs not sure on the whole having to be exact is as important as the archetype.

It'se kinda like how the earth gives its energy a bit?
