Mind = Int
Body = x
spirit = y
Int = Integer/Intelligence is a natural number in Time

or hash int as"i natural number". to have a natural number you have to have time space and a body to link it too.
In mathematics, an elliptic curve is a smooth, projective, algebraic curve of genus one, on which there is a specified point O

I= Integers. The letter (Z) is the symbol used to represent integers. An integer can be 0, a positive number to infinity, or a negative number to negative infinity.
A = function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y. The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function. This is saying an assigned fuction that that is call fuction that calls itself

M = The capital O in Maths is used to represent the null matrix, where all elements are zero... aka on the Cartesian coordinate system

so our Math is at a function that is set to zero
AF to set the funtion you need y and x 
y is usually the domain and x is the target
y = D (direction/domain)
  or
y=f(x)
Our agreed  funtion would be a funtion targeting a funtion.
But what we are getting here is A = functions where Y and X meet on the cartesian coordinate system that call out itself a funtion that returns a number that represent the null matrix

Ring theoretic properties of quantum grassmannians
A C Kelly, T H Lenagan, L Rigal
The m x n quantum grassmannian, G_q(m,n), is the subalgebra of the algebra of m x n quantum matrices that is generated by the maximal m x m quantum minors. Several properties of G_q(m,n) are established. In particular, a basis of G_q(m,n) is obtained, and it is shown that G_q(m,n) is a noetherian domain of Gelfand-Kirillov dimension m(n-m)+1. The algebra G_q(m,n) is identified as the subalgebra of coinvariants of a natural left coaction of the m x m quantum special linear group on the algebra of m x n quantum matrices and it is shown that G_q(m,n) is a maximal order.

This above is how blockchain works. its basically hiding a number in the quantum field (AES) encryption.

The de Broglie–Bohm theory, also known as the pilot wave theory, Bohmian mechanics, Bohm's interpretation, and the causal interpretation, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics. In addition to the wavefunction, it also postulates an actual configuration of particles exists even when unobserved. The evolution over time of the configuration of all particles is defined by a guiding equation. The evolution of the wave function over time is given by the Schrödinger equation

In theoretical physics, the pilot wave theory, also known as Bohmian mechanics, was the first known example of a hidden-variable theory, presented by Louis de Broglie in 1927. Its more modern version, the de Broglie–Bohm theory, interprets quantum mechanics as a deterministic theory, avoiding troublesome notions such as wave–particle duality, instantaneous wave function collapse, and the paradox of Schrödinger's cat. To solve these problems, the theory is inherently nonlocal.

Limits on sequential sharing of nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence
Ming-Liang Hu, Jia-Ru Wang, Heng Fan
Sequential sharing of nonlocal correlation is inherently related to its application. We address the question as to how many observers can share the nonlocal advantage of quantum coherence (NAQC) in a (d×d)-dimensional state with d being an arbitrary prime. We first recapitulate the d-dimensional unsharp measurements and analyze the trade-off between disturbance and information gain of the measurements. Then in a scenario where multiple Alices perform unsharp measurements on one party of the state sequentially and independently and a single Bob measures coherence of the conditional states on the other party, we show that at most one Alice can demonstrate NAQC with Bob. Such a limit holds even when considering the weak measurements with optimal pointer states. These results may shed light on the interplay between NAQC and quantum measurements on high-dimensional systems and the hierarchy of different quantum correlations.

The Bible narrative about Jacob and Esau has always been read historically, and theologians have had trouble trying to excuse Jacob and Rebekah for the apparent duplicity that they perpetrated upon Esau. When read in the light of spiritual understanding or considered as part of the history of the unfoldment of the individual soul, the incident loses its aspect of duplicity and we find that it is a description of the subtle working of the soul in spiritual evolution, under the guidance of Divine Mind. The soul is progressive. We must go forward. The soul must meet and overcome its limitations.

What is the meaning of Min a B?
Given two real numbers a and b, the notation min(a, b) denotes the smaller of the two numbers. In cases where a = b, then min(a, b) denotes the common value of a and b. It can be shown that min(a, b) can be expressed in terms of absolute value as follows: min(a, b) = (a + b - | a - b |)/2

The number e, also known as Euler's number, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828, and can be characterized in many ways. It is the base of the natural logarithms. It is the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series

The letter j is used to signify that a number is an imaginary number in electrical engineering.
Normally the letter i is used, but in electrical engineering j is used instead to avoid conflict with the symbol for current.

J = value is defined as the elastic potential difference between the linear and nonlinear elastic bodies with the same geometric variables.
 j is somtimes used as a substitute for i, usually in physics where the letter i is already used (i the intensity)
The imaginary unit or unit imaginary number (i) is a solution to the quadratic equation x2 + 1 = 0. Although there is no real number with this property, i can be used to extend the real numbers to what are called complex numbers, using addition and multiplication. A simple example of the use of i in a complex number is 2 + 3i.

2 + 3i is at the core the quantum block funtion.

Imaginary numbers are an important mathematical concept, which extend the real number system {R} to the complex number system {C} , in which at least one root for every nonconstant polynomial exists (see Algebraic closure and Fundamental theorem of algebra). Here, the term "imaginary" is used because there is no real number having a negative square.

There are two complex square roots of −1, namely i and −i, just as there are two complex square roots of every real number other than zero (which has one double square root).

In contexts in which use of the letter i is ambiguous or problematic, the letter j or the Greek ι is sometimes used instead. For example, in electrical engineering and control systems engineering, the imaginary unit is normally denoted by j instead of i, because i is commonly used to denote electric current.

                  -SI=In 2019, four of the seven SI base units specified in the International System of Quantities were redefined in terms of natural physical constants, rather than human artifacts such as the standard kilogram. Effective 20 May 2019, the 144th anniversary of the Metre Convention, the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole are now defined by setting exact numerical values, when expressed in SI units, for the Planck constant (h)

H = In metrology it is used, together with other constants, to define the kilogram, an SI unit. The SI units are defined in such a way that, when the Planck constant is expressed in SI units, it has the exact value h = 6.62607015×10−34 J⋅Hz

What is J in number?
We say it is imaginary. j is an imaginary number such that j2 = −1. Even though j is not real, using it we can formally write down the square roots of any negative number as shown in the following example. Example Write down expressions for the square roots of a) 9, b) −9.

S synch or the letter capital S represents the sum of a sequence of numbers, whereas the small “s” means the sample standard deviation. The Greek letter corresponding to the capital “S”, which is called “sigma” (∑) is also used to represent the sum of numbers in the sequence.
U-and ∩ is used when there are sets.
 -U (Union) means all the items arranged with no repeats.
 -∩ (Interception) means all the items that appear on two of the sets that is referred to.
