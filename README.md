#Mind = HASH (MBR) (BMR) (BRM)
#HvyHx: was about to delete all this stuff but I wrote MBR as MIND body spirit. But was trying to track R to both random and real. So i started tracking it to real things. So I #changed spirit to trying to track R instead

MBS Mind body spirit was what I was originally tracking but it turned into 
U is Usr random(r)

U = i 
R= (r)
r = random

Body = TR

what is HASH



Lets do a hash funtion of sorts. between in

INT=(int=T)
int=r

and

//EXTistence
E= (e)

when u=i

an IAM statement is HASH that consist of many things. that follows the pilot wave.
I= Integer
A = function from a set X to a set Y assigns to each element of X exactly one element of Y. The set X is called the domain of the function and the set Y is called the codomain of the function.
M = Messenger Master MATH measurement
D = D can be diameter, domain, a variable, or set.
f ◦ g

I AM GOD

I=()
A= AF

so now what we have is
(AF) + M GOD

A funtion that tells you its a function and then the remaining hash.
to set the funtion you need y and x 
y is usually the domain and x is the target
y = D 
  or
y=f(x)
 x here is asking for the domain. The Domain is the funtion.

This above is how blockchain works. its basically hiding a thing based on the quantum field (AES) encryption i do believe.

Something has me thinking this is kinda the battle of GOG and MA GOG.

quick glance at the letters GOG thats the GOG

HvyHx> note I wrote really far and then had to come back here to Fill in that yes it does check. this going forward and coming back to insert things is how blox or blocks
are calling in this quantum.. AES system witch would be the Alpha 

The number e, also known as Euler's number, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828, and can be characterized in many ways. It is the base of the natural logarithms. It is the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series


GOG and MA GOG
thats the Global Math a funtion set to IMO GOBAL CHAIN GLOBAL.. GOG.
Do you see how I M O means in my opinion and M gets turned into a W here?
i= thats my intellegence coming from me, as an ineger to a M (it both looks like a wave and stands for Math Messenger Or Masters)

This is the AES ring in quantum cryptography
because its assigning the A to the ∑ or e ruler synch.
Message◦master G
 the j.txn hash of this would be something like G Ø (or minuscule: ø) is D domain.

J = value is defined as the elastic potential difference between the linear and nonlinear elastic bodies with the same geometric variables

The imaginary unit or unit imaginary number (i) is a solution to the quadratic equation x2 + 1 = 0. Although there is no real number with this property, i can be used to extend the real numbers to what are called complex numbers, using addition and multiplication. A simple example of the use of i in a complex number is 2 + 3i.

2 + 3i is at the core the quantum block funtion.

Imaginary numbers are an important mathematical concept, which extend the real number system {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }\mathbb {R}  to the complex number system {C} , in which at least one root for every nonconstant polynomial exists (see Algebraic closure and Fundamental theorem of algebra). Here, the term "imaginary" is used because there is no real number having a negative square.

There are two complex square roots of −1, namely i and −i, just as there are two complex square roots of every real number other than zero (which has one double square root).

In contexts in which use of the letter i is ambiguous or problematic, the letter j or the Greek ι is sometimes used instead.[a] For example, in electrical engineering and control systems engineering, the imaginary unit is normally denoted by j instead of i, because i is commonly used to denote electric current.

Imaginary numbers are an important mathematical concept, which extend the real number system {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }\mathbb {R}  to the complex number system {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} }\mathbb {C} , in which at least one root for every nonconstant polynomial exists (see Algebraic closure and Fundamental theorem of algebra).

C = symbol: C) is the International System of Units (SI) unit of electric charge
                  -SI=In 2019, four of the seven SI base units specified in the International System of Quantities were redefined in terms of natural physical constants, rather than human artifacts such as the standard kilogram.[1][2] Effective 20 May 2019, the 144th anniversary of the Metre Convention, the kilogram, ampere, kelvin, and mole are now defined by setting exact numerical values, when expressed in SI units, for the Planck constant (h)

H = In metrology it is used, together with other constants, to define the kilogram, an SI unit.[1] The SI units are defined in such a way that, when the Planck constant is expressed in SI units, it has the exact value {\displaystyle h}h = 6.62607015×10−34 J⋅Hz

(starting to take j and go to to CHrist here it seems)
 
HvyHx: had to go fill in info about the MA GOG

E Euler's number, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828, and can be characterized in many ways. It is the base of the natural logarithms
S
U-and ∩ is used when there are sets.
 -U (Union) means all the items arranged with no repeats.
 -∩ (Interception) means all the items that appear on two of the sets that is referred to.

In mathematics, the letter capital S represents the sum of a sequence of numbers, whereas the small “s” means the sample standard deviation. The Greek letter corresponding to the capital “S”, which is called “sigma” (∑) is also used to represent the sum of numbers in the sequence.

$D$
The number e, also known as Euler's number, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828,
and can be characterized in many ways. It is the base of the natural logarithms.
It is the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest.

The letter j is used to signify that a number is an imaginary number in electrical engineering.
Normally the letter i is used, but in electrical engineering j is used instead to avoid conflict with the symbol for current.
